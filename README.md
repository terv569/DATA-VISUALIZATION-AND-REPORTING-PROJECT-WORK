Procedures for Breast Cancer Data Analysis

1. Data Loading:
The dataset was loaded using pandas with the following code:
import pandas as pd  
df = pd.read_csv("./Documents/breast-cancer.csv")  

2. Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing steps included:
Checking for missing values and duplicates.
Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding.
Scaling numerical features using StandardScaler.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA was performed to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.

4. Model Training:
Various machine learning models were trained, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.

6. Evaluation Metrics:
Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion:
The analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting breast cancer diagnosis.
